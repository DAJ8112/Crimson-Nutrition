# Crimson Nutrition

## Overview
Crimson Nutrition is a web application that utilizes computer vision to identify food items from images and retrieve their nutritional information. Users can upload or scan a photo of their food, and our model will classify it, fetching key nutritional details such as calories, protein, vitamins, and more from a relational database.

This project serves as a foundation for future expansions, ensuring a practical and user-friendly experience from the start.

## Research Background
We have studied various research papers that provide insights into computer vision-based food recognition:
- Amugongo et al. (2022) - Systematic review of mobile computer vision food recognition.
- Kawano & Yanai (2013) - Real-time mobile food recognition system.
- Rokhva et al. (2024) - Food recognition using MobileNetV2.

These studies help us understand CNN architectures such as AlexNet, VGG, GoogleNet, and ResNet, guiding our approach to food classification.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering high-quality food image datasets.
2. **Image Classification**: Training and evaluating CNN models for food recognition.
3. **Web Application Development**: Building a user-friendly interface that integrates image classification and nutritional data retrieval.


## Datasets
- **Food 101**: 101 food categories with 1000 images per category (750 Train, 250 Test).
- **Food 101 Tiny**: A subset for prototyping (10 categories, 150 Train, 50 Test).
- Additional food-related datasets may be explored or merged.

## Model Selection
We will experiment with multiple CNN architectures:
- **AlexNet**
- **VGG**
- **GoogleNet**
- **ResNet**
- **MobileNetV2** (as referenced in research papers)

We aim for high accuracy while considering computational efficiency.

## Challenges & Considerations
- **Large number of food categories**: Ensuring classification accuracy.
- **Computational power**: Estimating and managing training resources.
- **Real-world usability**: Creating a reliable and fast system.

## Future Directions
While our initial focus is food classification and nutritional retrieval, future improvements may include:
- Enhancing recognition accuracy with more diverse datasets.
- Estimating portion sizes and calorie intake.
- Expanding to a mobile application.

## Installation & Setup
(Details to be added once the project reaches the development stage.)
