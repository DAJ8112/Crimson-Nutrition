# Crimson Nutrition

## Overview
Crimson Nutrition is a web application that utilizes computer vision to identify food items from images and retrieve their nutritional information. Users can upload or scan a photo of their food, and our model will classify it, fetching key nutritional details such as calories, protein, vitamins, and more from a relational database.

This project serves as a foundation for future expansions, ensuring a practical and user-friendly experience from the start.
